# Block Qualified Circuits

Circuits implement the base logic of the protocol, and are used to obtain credentials and prove ownership of them.

## The Test Circuit
The [Test circuit](../../packages/circuits/circuits/test.circom) is how users prove that they have the necessary knowledge to pass a test and obtain a credential. It consists of three parts:
- [Proof of knowledge](#proof-of-knowledge)
- [Identity tree inclusion](#identity-tree-inclusion)
- [Grade tree inclusion](#grade-tree-inclusion)

### Proof of Knowledge
To solve a test, users provide as private inputs to the proof their `multipleChoiceAnswers` and `openAnswers`. The circuit then computes the resulting `grade â‹… nQuestions` as specified by the [Block Qualified Test](block-qualified-tests.md). This is the value that is later commited to the grade tree, alongside the user's identity secret. The circuit outputs the value for the `testRoot` and the `testParameters`, as specified by the [Block Qualified Test](block-qualified-tests.md). These values are then verified inside the [smart contracts](contracts.md).

### Identity Tree Inclusion
As part of the proof, the user updates an empty leaf (`identityTreeEmptyLeaf`) inside a [Semaphore Group](http://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/guides/groups) by including their [identity commitment](http://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/glossary#semaphore-identity). Depending on whether the user passed the test or not, this Semaphore group will be the credentials group or the no-credentials group, respectively. This is enforced inside of the [smart contracts](contracts.md).

The circuit outputs the old Merkle root of the Group (`oldIdentityTreeRoot`), the new Merkle root of the group (`newIdentityTreeRoot`), the user's identity commitment (`identityCommitment`), and its index within the tree (`identityCommitmentIndex`).

### Grade Tree Inclusion
Similarly to the identity tree inclusion, as part of the proof the user updates an empty leaf `gradeTreeEmptyLeaf` inside a Semaphore-like Group by including their grade commitment. Unlike a Semaphore [identity commitment](http://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/guides/identities#create-identities), which is computed as the Poseidon hash of the identity secret, a Block Qualified grade commitment is computed as:

$$
    \texttt{gradeCommitment} = \textrm{Poseidon}(\texttt{identitySecret}, \texttt{grade} \cdot \texttt{nQuestions})
$$

The circuit outputs the old Merkle root of the grade Semaphore-like Group (`oldGradeTreeRoot`), the new Merkle root of the Semaphore-like Group (`newGradeTreeRoot`), the user's grade commitment (`gradeCommitment`), and its inde within the tree (`gradeCommitmentIndex`).

## Proof of Ownership With Semaphore
Once a user has attempted to solve a credential, their identity commitment will be added to either the credentials group or the no-credentials group, depending on whether they passed the test or not, respectively. Using the [Semaphore](http://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/technical-reference/circuits) circuit, they can signal anonymously with a zero-knowledge proof that they are a part of the credentials/no-credentials group.

## The Grade Claim Circuit
Similarly to the Semaphore circuit, users can use the [Grade Claim circuit](../../packages/circuits/circuits/grade_claim.circom) to signal anonymously with a zero-knowledge proof that they obtained a grade that is greater than or equal to a certain threshold. This circuit works similarly to the [Semaphore](http://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/technical-reference/circuits) circuit, with two main differences:

- Instead of proving that their identity commitment is part of the tree, the user proves that their **grade commitment** is part of the tree. This grade commitment is linked to both their identity and the grade they obtained, as it is computed via: 
    $$
        \texttt{gradeCommitment} = \textrm{Poseidon}(\texttt{identitySecret}, \texttt{grade} \cdot \texttt{nQuestions})
    $$

- The user then proves that the grade linked to their grade commitment is above a certain threshold of their choosing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since the grade inside the grade commitment was weighted with the number of questions of the test, so should be the grade threshold that the user inputs. This is to avoid non-quadratic constaints, as covered in [Block Qualified Tests](block-qualified-tests.md).
{% endhint %}

The public signals for this circuit include those [_inherited_](http://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/technical-reference/circuits#proof-of-membership) from the Semaphore proof of ownership: `gradeTreeRoot` (the Merkle root of the grade tree), `nullifierHash`, `signalHash`, and `externalNullifier`. The circuit also outputs the weighted grade threshold, `weightedGradeThreshold`.
