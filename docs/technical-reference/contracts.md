# Block Qualified Contracts

The smart contracts for Block Qualified serve to verify the proofs generated by the circuits and integrate within Semaphore to add an additional privacy layer.

## Credentials.sol

The main smart contract for Block Qualified, [Credentials.sol](../../packages/contracts/contracts/base/Credentials.sol) allows users to create, manage and solve tests.

### Creating a Test

Anyone can create a new Block Qualified Test by calling the `createTest` function inside the smart contract, and providing:
- `minimumGrade`: out of 100, minimum total grade the user must get to obtain the credential.
- `multipleChoiceWeight`: out of 100, contribution of the multiple choice component towards the total grade.
- `nQuestions`: number of open answer questions the test has, up to a maximum of 64 -- must be set to 1 for pure multiple choice tests.
- `timeLimit`: unix time limit after which it is not possible to obtain this credential -- must set 0 for unlimited.
- `multipleChoiceRoot`: root of the correct multiple choice Merkle tree, where each leaf is the correct choice out of the given ones, as covered in [Block Qualified Tests](block-qualified-tests.md).
- `openAnswersHashesRoot`: root of the correct open answers Merkle tree, where each leaf is the hash of the corresponding correct answer, as covered in [Block Qualified Tests](block-qualified-tests.md).
- `testURI`: external resource containing the actual test and more information about the credential.

The resulting test is given a unique `testId`, and the address that made the `createTest` call will be given exclusive admin rights. The function then defines three new on-chain groups:

- The grade Semaphore-like group, that will contain all the grade commitments for every solving attempt, and whose `groupId = 3 ⋅ testId`.
- The credentials Semaphore group, that will contain all the identity commitments of the users that obtain the credential, and whose `groupId = 3 ⋅ testId + 1`.
- The no-credentials Semaphore group, that will contain all the identity commitments of the users that do not obtain the credential, and whose `groupId = 3 ⋅ testId + 2`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although these three groups are all given different `groupId`s, they are all constructed using the same `zeroLeaf` for gas saving purposes:

$$
    \texttt{zeroLeaf} = \textrm{keccak256}(\texttt{testId}) >> 8
$$
{% endhint %}

### Solving a Test
To obtain a credential, the user must call the `solveTest` function, providing a valid proof for the [Test circuit](circuits.md#the-test-circuit) that verifies their proof of knowledge of their solution. The user must specify in the `testPassed` boolean parameter for this function if their solution achieves a grade over `minimumGrade` or not.

The way this is enforced is by setting the `testParameters` public signal of the proof: 
- If the user sets `testPassed` to **true**, the public input `testParameters` set when verifying the proof will make it **invalid** if the grade obtained is below `minimumGrade`.
- If the user sets `testPassed` to **false**, the public input `testParamters` will set the `minimumGrade` to 0, so the grade check inside the proof will clear.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This means that a user can potentially provide a passing solution and still decide to add themselves to the no-credentials group.
{% endhint %}

Depending on the value for `testPassed`, the user will get their Semaphore identity commitment added to the credentials group or to the no-credentials group, respectively. Their grade commitment will be added to the grade group either way.

The height of these three trees is set by the `N_LEVELS` parameter, fixed at 16. This gives us a maximum of 65536 leaves.

### Creating Restricted Tests
Credential issuers can choose to restrict their tests to users that either hold or obtained a grade over a certain threshold for another credential. To obtain this credential, users will need to additionally prove that they pass these requirements.

#### Creating a Credential Restricted Test
Anyone can create a new Block Qualified credential restricted test by calling the `createCredentialRestrictedTest` function inside the smart contract. This function is similar to the `createTest` function, but users will have to additionally provide:
- `requiredCredential`: the `testId` of the credential that users must prove ownership of before being able to solve the test.

The resulting test is given a unique `testId`, and defines the same three groups as [`createTest`](#creating-a-test). To gain these credentials, users will first have to prove that they own the `requiredCredential`.

#### Creating a Grade Restricted Test
Anyone can create a new Block Qualified grade restricted test by calling the `createGradeRestrictedTest` function inside the smart contract. This function is similar to the `createCredentialRestrictedTest` function, but users will have to additionally provide:
- `requiredCredentialGradeThreshold`: a minimum grade which users must prove they have obtained on the `requiredCredential` before being able to solve the test.

The resulting test is given a unique `testId`, and defines the same three groups as [`createTest`](#creating-a-test). To gain these credentials, users will first have to prove that they obtained a grade that is above the `requiredCredentialGradeThreshold` for the `requiredCredential`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that every user that provides a valid proof via `solveTest` gets their grade commitment added to the grade tree, regardless of whether they obtained the credential or not. This means that some users from the no-credentials group can pass this restriction if the `requiredCredentialGradeThreshold` is set below the `requiredCredential`'s `minimumGrade`.
{% endhint %}

### Solving Restricted Tests
To obtain a restricted credential, besides providing a proof for the [Test circuit](circuits.md#the-test-circuit), users must provide a proof showing that they pass the restrictions.

#### Solving a Credential Restricted Test
To obtain a credential restricted credential, users must call the `solveCredentialRestrictedTest` function, providing a valid proof for the [Test circuit](circuits.md#the-test-circuit) plus an additional [Semaphore proof](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/guides/proofs) that verifies that they own the `requiredCredential`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The external nullifier being used to prevent double-signaling is the string `bq-credential-restricted-test`.
{% endhint %}

#### Solving a Grade Restricted Test
To obtain a grade restricted credential, users must call the `solveGradeRestrictedTest` function, providing a valid proof for the [Test circuit](circuits.md#the-test-circuit) plus an additional [grade claim proof](circuits.md#the-grade-claim-circuit) that verifies that they obtained a grade above the `requiredCredentialGradeThreshold` for the `requiredCredential`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The external nullifier being used to prevent double-signaling is the string `bq-grade-restricted-test`.
{% endhint %}

### Rating the Credential Issuer
After generating a valid Semaphore proof that provides a [rating](../guides/functionalities/credential-issuer-rating.md) for the credential issuer, users can publish these directly on-chain by calling the `rateIssuer` function and providing:
- `testId`: the ID of the test they are giving the rating to.
- `rating`: the rating they gave to the credential issuer, which must be less than or equal to 100.
- `comment`: a comment they gave to the credential issuer.
- `proof` and `proofInputs`: the semaphore proof that verifies that they own this credential and is linked to the `rating` and `comment` they provided.

After verifying the proof, the `rating` is recorded on-chain. The average rating for a test can be accessed by calling `getTestAverageRating` and specifying the `testId`. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The external nullifier being used to prevent double-signaling is the string `bq-grade-restricted-test`.
{% endhint %}

### Verifying Credential Ownership Proofs
External contracts can verify credential ownership proofs by calling the `verifyCredentialOwnershipProof` function, providing the `testId` of the credential and a valid [Semaphore proof](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/guides/proofs).

### Verifying Grade Claim Proofs
External contracts can verify grade claim proofs by calling the `verifyGradeClaimProof` function, providing the `testId` of the credential and a valid [grade claim proof](circuits.md#the-grade-claim-circuit) that verifies that they obtained a grade above the `gradeThreshold` they specified.

### Verifying a Test
The admin of a test can choose to _verify it_ by providing the open answer hashes needed to solve this test directly on-chain, which is done by calling the function `verifyTest`.

### Invalidating a Test
The admin of a test can choose to invalidate it, so that users can no longer attempt to solve it, by calling the function `invalidateTest`.
