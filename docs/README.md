## What is Block Qualified?

Block Qualified aims to become an open education platform where users can create their own learning experience. Anyone can gain credentials that attest to their knowledge, or verify the qualifications of others. All of this being done directly on-chain, with verifiable data, and preserving the privacy of users via zk proofs.

Users can define their own on-chain exams where they evaluate some kind of knowledge. Anyone can come in an attempt to solve this test: if they do so, they prove that they have the necessary knowledge. We call the creator of the test the _credential issuer_, while _solvers_ are the ones gaining the credentials.
