# TestCredential Object

The [TestCredential](../../packages/lib/src/testCredential.ts) object abstracts most of the Block Qualified logic away, allowing you to easily interact with the protocol. It incorporates an [OpenZeppelin Autotask](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/autotasks) for a [transaction relayer](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/relay), making it easier to onboard users.
